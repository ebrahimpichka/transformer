A simple from-scratch implementation of the Transformer architecture from "Attention is all you need" papr by Google.

transformers are network architectures, based on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions, for sequence to sequence encoding.

a simple transformesr architecture has been implemented using PyTorch framework.
